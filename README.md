# On Littering

## Littering

Littering is a method developped to measure the benefits of custom allocators without unfairly favoritizing the shimmed
version of the program. It works by running a short pre-conditioning step before starting the program, allocating and
freeing objects successively to artifically fragment the heap. This simulates real conditions of long-running programs,
where fragmentation is inevitable.

More precisely, our version littering works in two steps.
 1. `LD_PRELOAD=libdetector.so <program>`. This keeps track of every allocated object's size, binning sizes to obtain a
    rough size distribution of the objects used by the program. It also keeps track of a few statistics we can calculate
    online, such as mean, min/max, and most importantly `MaxLiveAllocations`.
 2. `LD_PRELOAD=liblitterer.so <program>`. This is when we actually run the litterering step, along with the program
    when done. This works by allocating `LITTER_MULTIPLIER * MaxLiveAllocations` objects following the recorded size
    distribution, (optionally) shuffling the addresses, and freeing a fraction of `1 - LITTER_OCCUPANCY` of them. We
    use the same `malloc` as the program will, hence the program will start with existing "litter" on the heap. There
    are a few tunable parameters.
     -  `LITTER_SEED`: Seed to be used for the random number generator. Random by default.
     -  `LITTER_OCCUPANCY`: Fraction of objects to _keep_ on the heap. Value must be between 0 and 1.
     -  `LITTER_NO_SHUFFLE`: Set to 1 to disable shuffling, and free from the last allocated objects.
     -  `LITTER_SLEEP`: Sleep _x_ seconds after littering, but before starting the program. Default is disabled.
     -  `LITTER_MULTIPLIER`: Multiplier of number of objects to allocate. Default is 20.

## Experimental Platform

Data was obtained on a Thinkpad P15s Gen 2 with an Intel i7-1165G7 processor.

|          | Version |
|----------|---------|
| glibc    | 2.31    |
| jemalloc | 5.3.0   |
| mimalloc | 2.0.6   |

Results below were obtained with `LITTER_MULTIPLIER = 1`, varying the occupancy number.

## Graphs

First, some `197.parser` specific graphs, using the Linux default allocator, jemalloc, and mimalloc.
The elapsed time graph is normalized by the elapsed time of the program running with the custom allocator, no littering.

We also generate graphs separating events counted with `perf`. We assign events in/out malloc based on which DSO the
sample comes from.
