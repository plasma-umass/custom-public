# Reconsidering "Reconsidering Custom Memory Allocation"

[Nicolas van Kempen](https://nvankempen.com/), [Emery D. Berger](https://emeryberger.com/)

In this work, we revisit the _Reconsidering Custom Memory Allocation_ paper[^1]. That widely-cited paper (selected as a Most Influential Paper[^2]) conducted a study that
demonstrated that in many cases, custom memory allocators do not provide significant performance benefits over a good general-purpose memory allocator.

## Littering

To combat this effect, we developed _littering_, an approach to measure the benefits of custom allocators without unfairly favoring the shimmed
version of the program. Littering works by first running a short pre-conditioning step before starting the program, allocating and
freeing objects to  fragment the heap. Unlike starting from a clean heap, littering simulates the conditions of a long-running program,
where fragmentation is inevitable.

More precisely, littering works in two phases:
 1. **Detection** We run the program as usual, but with a _Detector_ library (`LD_PRELOAD=libdetector.so <program>`) that keeps track of every allocated object's size, binning sizes to obtain a
    rough size distribution of the objects used by the program, which it produces as output to be consumed in the littering phase. Detector also keeps track of several allocation statistics,
    including mean, min/max, and most importantly, `MaxLiveAllocations`.
 2. **Littering** With the statistics and histogram in hand, we next run littering (`LD_PRELOAD=liblitterer.so <program>`). Littering allocaties `LITTER_MULTIPLIER * MaxLiveAllocations` objects following the recorded size
    distribution, (optionally) shuffling the addresses, and freeing a fraction of `1 - LITTER_OCCUPANCY` of them. We
    use the same `malloc` as the program, so the program starts with the heap in a littered state. There
    are a few tunable parameters, which can be provided as environment variables:
     -  `LITTER_SEED`: Seed to be used for the random number generator. Random by default.
     -  `LITTER_OCCUPANCY`: Fraction of objects to _keep_ on the heap. Value must be between 0 and 1.
     -  `LITTER_NO_SHUFFLE`: Set to 1 to disable shuffling, and free from the last allocated objects.
     -  `LITTER_SLEEP`: Sleep _x_ seconds after littering, but before starting the program. Default is disabled.
     -  `LITTER_MULTIPLIER`: Multiplier of number of objects to allocate. Default is 20.

## Experimental Platform

Data was obtained on a Thinkpad P15s Gen 2 with an Intel i7-1165G7 processor.

|          | Version |
|----------|---------|
| glibc    | 2.31    |
| jemalloc | 5.3.0   |
| mimalloc | 2.0.6   |

Results below were obtained with `LITTER_MULTIPLIER = 1`, varying the occupancy number.

## Graphs

First, some `197.parser` specific graphs, using the Linux default allocator, jemalloc, and mimalloc.
The elapsed time graph is normalized by the elapsed time of the program running with the custom allocator, no littering.

We also generate graphs separating events counted with `perf`. We assign events in/out malloc based on which DSO the
sample comes from.
